# NumeroWeb

This is a dummy web to check your Numerology, presented in Vietnamese (so please skip this repo if you cannot read Vietnamese)

I used nodejs as BE and angular as FE

Step to run:
- Clone proj
- npm install (you can check npm version in package.json)
- npm run build
- npm run start
- go to http://localhost:8080/

I developed this while learning nodejs to find job, but I have been hired before it's finished. 
So this project remains undone :D
